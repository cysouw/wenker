Multialignment of Wenker sentences

This repository is an attempt to use multialignment to analyze the data from a translational dialect survey, viz. the infamous Wenker survey of German dialects from the late 19th Century. A selection of 2500 specimens of the original data is transcribed by Jürg Fleischer and his students, and the process of multialignment is applied by Michael Cysouw, currently focussing on the German and Dutch data (ignoring the French, Danish and Polish translation). The processing proceeds sentence by sentence, and first processed datafiles are in `data`. Some first results can be found in `analyses` and some notes on the methodology in `papers/methodology`.
